Hey there! 👋 I'm Puja Ammineni
Welcome to my little corner of the internet! If you're here, you probably love AI, Generative Models, and building cool things with LLMs—just like me. 🚀

🧠 My Journey into AI
I’ve always been fascinated by how machines understand, generate, and interact with information—whether it's text, images, or speech. My passion led me to explore LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and AI Agents, and now, I spend my time building AI-powered solutions that make life easier.

Right now, I’m a Research Assistant at Michigan Tech, where I get to fine-tune models, experiment with RAG architectures, and deploy AI solutions at scale. Whether it's chatbots, multimodal AI systems, or document intelligence assistants, I love the challenge of making AI smarter, faster, and more efficient.

🚀 What I Do Best
🔹 Build & Fine-Tune LLMs – I work with GPT-4o, Llama3, Hugging Face models, and optimize them with QLoRA, LoRA, and RAG techniques.
🔹 AI Agents & Automation – I create autonomous AI agents that interact, learn, and make decisions using CrewAI, AutoGen, and Agentic AI.
🔹 Generative AI for Real-World Applications – From AI-powered chatbots to speech synthesis tools, I specialize in building & deploying AI solutions that solve real problems.
🔹 Cloud & MLOps – I deploy AI models on AWS, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face Spaces, and optimize performance using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD workflows.

🛠 My Favorite Tools & Tech
💡 LLMs & AI Models: GPT-4o, Llama3, Gemini Pro, Hugging Face
🔍 RAG & Vector Search: FAISS, ChromaDB, Pinecone, LangChain
🎨 Multimodal AI: Image-to-Text, Speech Synthesis, Conversational AI
🌎 Cloud & DevOps: AWS, Azure, Hugging Face, FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes

🏆 Cool Wins & Highlights
🎯 Built a ChatGPT-like web assistant for document analysis using GPT-4o & LangChain, improving research efficiency by 35%.
💡 Developed an AI-powered chatbot that automated supply chain queries, saving $100K in just 4 months.
🏆 Won AI Hackathon 2021 for an innovative AI-driven automation tool.
📢 Mentored 300+ students in Python & AI through workshops and hackathons.
